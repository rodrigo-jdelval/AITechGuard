# PoC AITechGuard: AI Technologies Security Recommendations Analyzer

AITechGuard is a tool designed to analyze and generate security recommendations for cloud environments, specifically for technologies like **Microsoft Azure**, **AWS**, and **Google Cloud**. The tool uses an advanced language model (LLM) to provide python code to verify actual state, cost / benefit analisys and prioritized implementation plan of the selected framework-based recommendations.

## Key Features

- **Technology and Subtechnology Selection**: Allows you to select primary technologies (Microsoft, AWS, Google Cloud) and their associated subtechnologies (e.g., Azure (Cloud Computing), Windows Server, etc.).
- **Workload Identification**: Detects common cloud workloads, such as Virtual Machines (VMs), containers, databases, web applications, etc.
- **Security Recommendations**: Generates detailed security recommendations for each workload, including:
  - Severity (Low, Medium, High).
  - MITRE ATT&CK Techniques.
  - MITRE ATT&CK Tactics.
  - TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures).
- **Recommendation Verification**: Allows you to verify if recommendations can be automatically validated using tools like Azure Checker.
- **Verification Code Generation**: Generates Python code to validate the state of recommendations in Azure environments.
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Provides a detailed analysis of the cost and benefit of implementing recommendations.
- **Implementation Plan**: Generates an implementation plan in Gantt chart format, including time and resource estimates.

## Prerequisites

To run CloudGuard, you will need:

1. **Python 3.8 or higher**.
2. **Streamlit**: Framework for the user interface.
3. **LiteLLM**: To interact with the Groq language model.
4. **Plotly**: To generate Gantt charts.
5. **Groq API Key**: Set the `GROQ_API_KEY` environment variable with your API key.

Install the dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install streamlit plotly litellm
```

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/CloudGuard.git
cd CloudGuard
```

2. Set up the Groq API key:

```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

3. Run the application:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## How to Use the Tool

### Step 1: Technology Selection
- Select the technologies you want to evaluate (Microsoft, AWS, Google Cloud).

### Step 2: Subtechnology Selection
- Choose the subtechnologies associated with the selected technologies (e.g., Azure (Cloud Computing), Windows Server, etc.).

### Step 3: Workload Selection
- Select the workloads you have in your environment (e.g., Virtual Machines, Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure SQL Database, etc.).

### Step 4: Generate Recommendations
- The tool will generate detailed security recommendations for the selected workloads.

### Step 5: Verify Recommendations
- Select the recommendations you want to verify and generate Python code to validate their state in Azure.

### Step 6: Execute Verification Code
- Python code to verify the state of the eecommendation will be generated by the AI.
- Python Dependencies will be showned.
- Needed permissions will be showned.
- Provide credentials (Subscription ID, Client ID, Client Secret, Tenant ID) and execute the generated code.
- Execute Python code outside the application.
- Paste results in the application.

### Step 7: Cost-Benefit Analysis
- Get a detailed analysis of the cost and benefit of implementing the recommendations.

### Step 8: Implementation Plan
- Generate an implementation plan with time and resource estimates.
